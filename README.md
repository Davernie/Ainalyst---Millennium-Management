Project Plan

Phase 1: Research & Setup  

  Task 1: Explore Ruff & Flake8 
- Understand how Ruff and Flake8 detect PEP8 violations.  
- Determine input/output formats for both tools.  
- Check if they provide API or CLI-based integration.  
- Explore Jenkins plugins for integrating Ruff/Flake8.  

  Task 2: Explore AST Parsing for Logical & Security Issues  
- Investigate how Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) help identify deeper issues.  
- Explore Python AST libraries like `ast`, `lib2to3`, `RedBaron`.  
- Identify methods for detecting security vulnerabilities and logical flaws.  

  Task 3: Setup Jenkins Integration with GitLab
- Set up Jenkins and integrate it with the GitLab repository.  
- Configure webhooks or Jenkins plugins to trigger a pipeline on PR creation.  
- Keep the initial workflow minimal (just build the project, no deployments yet).  

  Task 4: Define OpenAI/Local AI Model for Code Fixing  
- Explore OpenAI API (Codex/GPT).  
- Research local models (e.g., CodeT5, CodeBERT) for self-hosted solutions.  
- Compare API latency, accuracy, and feasibility for integration.

Phase 2: PR Management & AI Integration  

  Task 5: Link GitLab PRs with Jira for Issue Tracking  
- Automate linking GitLab PRs to a Jira project.  
- Ensure each PR is associated with a Jira issue for tracking.  
- Use Jira API or GitLab integrations to establish this link.  

  Task 6: Implement Jenkins Workflow for PEP8 & AST Analysis  
- Run PEP8 compliance checks inside the Jenkins pipeline.  
- Integrate AST parsing to detect logical flaws & security vulnerabilities.  
- Extract non-compliant code snippets for review.  
- Validate findings and log them for AI correction.  

  Task 7: Develop FastAPI Backend for Code Analysis 
- Create an API endpoint to accept code submissions.  
- Process PEP8 violations and AST-flagged issues.  
- Return flagged issues & AI-suggested fixes.  
- Store analysis results in PostgreSQL.

Phase 3: AI-Driven Code Correction & PR Generation  

  Task 8: Automate AI-Powered Code Fixing  
- Implement OpenAI API to suggest and apply code corrections.  
- Ensure fixes **preserve logic and do not introduce new issues.  
- Validate AI fixes with unit tests before applying.  

  Task 9: Push Auto-Fixed Code Back to GitLab  
- Automate commits with AI-modified code.  
- Create a new PR with auto-corrected code changes.  
- Ensure developers can review and accept/reject AI suggestions.  

  Task 10: Extract PR Titles & Descriptions from Git Diffs**  
- Analyze commit messages and diffs.  
- Generate **meaningful PR titles based on code changes.  
- Summarize modifications in a structured format.  

  Task 11: Automate PR Title & Description Generation in Jenkins  
- Integrate OpenAI API for PR title automation.  
- Format PR descriptions based on extracted Git Diffs.  
- Ensure correct tagging & consistency in GitLab PRs.

Phase 4: Frontend Integration & Testing  

  Task 12: Develop a React Frontend for the Code Review Dashboard  
- Display flagged issues from PEP8, AST parsing, and AI fixes.  
- Allow manual corrections before committing.  
- Provide a history log for AI-generated changes.  

  Task 13: Jenkins Workflow Validation & Testing  
- Add unit tests & rollback mechanisms to prevent AI-introduced bugs.  
- Implement error logging & debugging for AI-generated code changes.  
- Test AI fixes across multiple Python repositories for robustness.  

  Task 14: Performance Optimization & Deployment  
- Optimize AI model execution for real-time suggestions.  
- Improve database queries for faster response times.  
- Deploy the system in a cloud/local environment.
